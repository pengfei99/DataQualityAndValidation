# Great expectations

In this project, we use `Great expectations` to check the validity of data. 

# Pros:
- Declarative validation rule 
- Rich built-in validation rule
- Easy to implement new validation rules
- Able to reuse existing validation rule set
- Provide a profiler to generate possible validation rules for a given dataset.
- Detailed validation report that indicates which validation rule failed and which row failed the validation rule
- Light language dependencies (validation rule in json, project config (e.g. checkpoint, data source) in yaml. Python only for running project)


# Cons:
- Validation rules generated by Profiler have low relevance.
- Many concept to understand
